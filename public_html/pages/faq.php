                                 You will not be stuck with the teams you selected from the draft. You can switch a team one of two ways. First, you can go to the Add/Drop page
                                 and select teams from the available team list and then select the same number of teams from your roster on the bottom and click complete. If you 
                                 wish to have a team that another user in the league owns, you go to the Trade page and offer them a team of your own. There is no guarantee that
                                 the other user will accept the trade however.
